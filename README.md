# PipelineCPU

This is a SystemVerilog implementation of a 5-stage pipeline CPU of MIPS architecture.

The CPU can support 50+ instructions.

The files are tested under ISim.

Bonus: The Logisim implementations of the MIPS lite(in single sycle) and lite2 (in pipeline) are also provieded for visualization.

Note:

The overview of the 5-stage pipeline is presented in `PipelineOverview.png`.

The top structure of the SystemVerilog implementation is in `mips-pipeline-top.v`.
